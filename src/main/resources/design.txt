SpaceMap

An embedded tomcay of springboot was used which enable one to run the program as a java application

At the beginning of the app, data will be stored into Derby database as per instructions and a @PostContruct annotation
has been used to make this possible without the use of endpoints.


Endpoints:
1- To view all the planets
http://localhost:8080/listPlanets

2-  To calculate the shortest distance between two planets
http://localhost:8080/calculateDistance

Project Design and Tools Used;
1. Spring Boot framework.
2. Dependency and build management - maven.
3. Apache POI for importing the data from excel sheet.
4. Embedded database - Apache Derby.
5. spring-data-jpa to persist data to the database.
6. Hibernate for Entity management.
7. Front-end spring MVC(JSP) and bootstrap for styling
8. Servlet container - Apache tomcat.

Areas that could implement:

1. Exception Handling with resource bundle for error messages.
2. Logging could be implemented
3. Method and class comments for better unstanding of the code.
4. Good UX and UI design
